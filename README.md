# 🚀 Capstone Project: Elevate Your ML Models to Production Scale!

## Unveiling a Robust MLOps Pipeline on AWS EKS

Welcome to a showcase of cutting-edge MLOps practices, transforming raw machine learning ideas into resilient, production-ready applications. This project is your blueprint for building, deploying, and monitoring ML models with confidence and precision.

---

## ✨ What You'll Experience

This project isn't just code; it's a journey through the modern MLOps landscape, empowering you to:

* **🎬 Orchestrate Seamless Pipelines:** Automate every step, from data ingestion to model deployment.
* **🔍 Track Every Experiment:** Gain crystal-clear insights into your model's evolution, parameters, and performance.
* **🛡️ Version Control Beyond Code:** Manage your datasets and model artifacts with the same rigor as your source code.
* **📦 Containerize with Confidence:** Package your application for consistent performance across any environment.
* **🔗 Embrace Continuous Everything:** Implement automated workflows for testing, building, and deploying your ML services.
* **🌐 Deploy Globally, Scale Infinitely:** Leverage the power of Kubernetes on AWS for elastic, reliable model serving.
* **👁️ Monitor & Optimize in Real-Time:** Keep a pulse on your application's health and performance in production.

## 🌟 Technologies at the Core

We've harnessed an impressive array of industry-leading tools and services to bring this vision to life:

* **Version Control:** Git & **DVC** (Data Version Control)
* **Experiment Tracking:** **MLflow** (integrated with **DagsHub**)
* **Containerization:** **Docker**
* **Cloud Artifact Storage:** **AWS S3** & **ECR** (Elastic Container Registry)
* **CI/CD Automation:** **GitHub Actions**
* **Kubernetes Orchestration:** **Amazon EKS** (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
* **Monitoring & Visualization:** **Prometheus** & **Grafana**

## 🛠️ Journey to Deployment: A Glimpse

Embark on a structured path from your local development environment all the way to a monitored production service in the cloud.

1.  **Local Foundations:** Set up your project structure and dedicated Python environment.
2.  **DagsHub Integration:** Connect your repository to DagsHub for seamless experiment tracking and collaboration.
3.  **Data & Pipeline Versioning:** Initialize DVC to meticulously track your data and define your ML pipelines.
4.  **Cloud Storage Power-Up:** Link DVC to AWS S3 for robust and scalable data storage.
5.  **Flask Application Crafting:** Develop your lightweight web service to serve your ML model.
6.  **CI/CD Blueprint:** Define your GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds and deployments.
7.  **Dockerize Your App:** Create a Docker image to encapsulate your Flask application and its dependencies.
8.  **ECR Registry:** Push your container images to AWS ECR, your private Docker registry.
9.  **EKS Cluster Launch:** Provision a highly available Kubernetes cluster on AWS.
10. **Automated EKS Deployment:** Let GitHub Actions orchestrate the deployment of your containerized app to EKS.
11. **Real-time Monitoring:** Set up Prometheus to collect metrics from your live application.
12. **Interactive Dashboards:** Visualize your application's performance and health using Grafana.

## 🌐 Behind the Scenes: Core Concepts Explained

* **CloudFormation's Role:** Discover how AWS CloudFormation underpins EKS, enabling infrastructure as code for your cluster.
* **Understanding Fleet Requests:** Grasp the mechanics of how EKS provisions EC2 instances and how to manage potential quotas.
* **Persistent Storage in K8s (PVCs):** Learn about Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaims, your key to durable storage for stateful applications.
